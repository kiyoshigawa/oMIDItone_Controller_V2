/*
This is a library designed to work with the Teensy MIDI libraries to control
a MIDI device from the Teensy.

The library is designed to keep track of all incoming MIDI messages and maintain
a 'state-of-the-synth' controller object that has current information based on
the sum total of all MIDI messages received to that point.

/*
These are MIDI CC values and their corresponding defined functions per the 
official MIDI specs. Some of them perform default functions on the 
MIDIController class, while most do not. CC values 6, 38, 96-101, and 120-127 
all have default handlers assigned per the MIDI specs. It is NOT recommended to
assign custom handlers to these values unless you want to go against the default
MIDI specifications for their behavior.

Assigning custom handlers to any of the above CC values will cause other 
functionality of the MIDIController class to break. This includes RPN settings
such as changing the pitch bend offsets, tuning functions, and 3D synth 
parameters. Modifying CC120-127 will break useful features like omni/poly/mono
mode support, as well as the all notes off, all sounds off, reset all 
controllers, and local control settings. 

Only assign these handlers if you know what you're doing and dislike the MIDI
official specification defaults.
